Great reviews catch risks early without slowing the team. Here’s a concise playbook you can drop into your workflow tomorrow.

## What reviewers optimize

- **Correctness and risk:** bugs, data corruption, security gaps.  
- **Alignment:** architecture boundaries, conventions, and product acceptance criteria.  
- **Maintainability:** clarity, tests, and observability hooks.

## Reviewer checklist

- Scope small PRs (<400 lines touched) or ask for a split.  
- Read the **intent first** (issue, design doc, PR description).  
- Check **interfaces and contracts** before implementation details.  
- Look for **testing deltas:** missing edge cases, flaky patterns, no regression test for the bug fixed.  
- Verify **observability:** logs/metrics/traces for new flows or failure paths.

## Author habits that speed things up

- Write a crisp PR description: problem, approach, trade-offs, testing.  
- Add **screenshots or clips** for UI changes; link to **metrics** for perf changes.  
- Flag areas where you want extra scrutiny.  
- Keep commits reviewable: logical chunks with passing tests.

## Making decisions

- Prefer **blocking comments only for correctness or safety**; use non-blocking for style.  
- When you disagree, suggest an **alternative** or ask for data.  
- Capture outcomes in the PR summary or an ADR if architectural.

## Metrics to watch

- Time to first response.  
- Review depth: number of substantive comments vs. nits.  
- Defects found post-merge.  
- PR size distribution.

## Anti-patterns

- Drive-by LGTM without reading.  
- Perfectionism that ignores business context.  
- Piling on nits without auto-formatters/linters in place.  
- Unclear ownership: who can approve? who is responsible for risk?
