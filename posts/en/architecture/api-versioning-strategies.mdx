APIs that live more than a quarter inevitably change. Good versioning lets you ship new capabilities while keeping existing consumers stable. Here’s a field guide that balances simplicity, safety, and speed.

## Principles

- **Compatibility first:** avoid breaking changes; add, don’t mutate or remove.  
- **Predictable evolution:** publish rules for deprecation, removal, and support timelines.  
- **Discoverability:** make the served version explicit (headers or URLs), not implicit.

## Versioning styles

1) **URI versioning** (`/v1/`): clear, cache-friendly, and easy to route; best default for HTTP APIs.  
2) **Header versioning** (`Accept: application/vnd.acme+json; version=2`): keeps URLs stable; good for public APIs needing fine-grained media types.  
3) **Field-level versioning**: add new fields with defaults; rarely need a new major version if you can stay backward compatible.

## When to cut a major version

- Removing or renaming fields/paths.  
- Changing required parameters or semantics.  
- Switching representations (e.g., pagination model, auth scheme).

If you must break, run v1 and v2 side-by-side for a migration window, with analytics and alerting on v1 usage.

## Backward-compatible playbook

- Only **add** fields; never change meaning of existing ones.  
- Mark deprecated fields in schema docs and emit `Deprecation` headers.  
- Use **defaultable** params instead of new required ones.  
- Add **feature flags** to expose new behaviors before freezing the contract.

## Governance that scales

- Keep an ADR for each breaking change decision.  
- Require **contract tests** from consumers before removing old versions.  
- Track version usage per client; set removal dates in release notes and status page.  
- Automate linting for OpenAPI/Protobuf compatibility (e.g., `vacuum`, `buf` breaking checks).

## Migration kit for clients

- Provide a changelog and “diff” examples between versions.  
- Supply SDKs or typed clients that smooth breaking edges.  
- Offer **sandbox environments** and replay tools so clients can validate quickly.

## Checklist before releasing vNext

- Version routing exercised in staging with real traffic replay.  
- Monitoring per version (rate, errors, latency).  
- Deprecation headers live for at least one full client release cycle.  
- Rollback plan: keep old version hot and data-compatible.

Thoughtful versioning keeps teams moving without leaving consumers behind. Treat contracts as products: documented, measured, and supported.
