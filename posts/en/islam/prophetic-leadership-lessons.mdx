Leadership in Islam is stewardship, not status. The Prophet ﷺ modeled principles that modern teams still crave.

## Trust before tasks

- Delegate with clear expectations and sincere dua for the person’s success.  
- Avoid micro-management; measure outcomes, not keystrokes.

## Shura (consultation)

- Seek diverse opinions before major decisions; document options and reasons to build collective buy-in.  
- Rotate who speaks first to avoid anchoring on hierarchy.

## Mercy in feedback

- Correct in private, praise in public.  
- Pair critique with a path to improvement; never shame.

## Justice and accountability

- Apply rules consistently—family and friends are not exempt.  
- Own mistakes publicly and compensate those affected.

## Service mindset

- Lead by serving: take unglamorous tasks occasionally to signal shared responsibility.  
- Make dua for your team; spiritual support strengthens morale.

Prophetic leadership blends firmness with compassion, creating teams that trust, perform, and feel seen.
