Khushu’ is learned attention. A more present prayer can steady your day and decisions.

## Before prayer

- Disconnect for 2 minutes: silence notifications, close laptops.  
- Make wudu slowly; treat it as a reset ritual rather than a rush.

## During prayer

- Visualize standing before Allah; softly follow each verse meaning in your language.  
- Anchor wandering thoughts by returning to the sound of your own recitation.

## After prayer

- Sit for a brief dhikr set; breathe deeply with each tasbih.  
- Write one intention for the next task—carry the calm into action.

## Building consistency

- Pick one surah and learn its tafsir; rotate monthly to keep engagement fresh.  
- Pray at the earliest time; delaying increases distraction risk.

Focused salah trains focus elsewhere. Treat each prayer as a daily mindfulness practice gifted within the deen.
