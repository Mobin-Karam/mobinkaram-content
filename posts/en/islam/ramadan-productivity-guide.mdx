Ramadan is for worship, not burnout. This guide balances ibadah with daily responsibilities.

## Fuel smart at suhoor

- Complex carbs + protein (oats, eggs, yogurt) and plenty of water; limit salt and caffeine.  
- Finish suhoor 10–15 minutes before Fajr to allow calm dhikr.

## Plan worship blocks

- Anchor nights around Taraweeh/Qiyam; set micro-goals for Quran (e.g., 10 pages after each salah).  
- Use commute or walks for audio tafsir instead of random podcasts.

## Work adjustments

- Schedule deep work in the morning; reserve afternoons for lighter tasks and reviews.  
- Batch meetings; request shorter slots with agendas to reduce fatigue.

## Health and rest

- Power naps (15–25 minutes) after Dhuhr or before iftar.  
- Gentle movement: stretching or short walks keep energy stable.

## Charity and community

- Pre-plan donations; automate nightly giving to catch Laylat al-Qadr.  
- Share iftar with neighbors or colleagues to strengthen ties.

With intentional planning, Ramadan becomes a month of renewal rather than exhaustion—productivity in service of worship.
