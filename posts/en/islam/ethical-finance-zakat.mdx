We handle money through apps and brokers, but the principles of halal income and zakat stay constant. Here’s a pragmatic checklist.

## Earning halal

- Verify revenue streams: avoid interest-bearing products and businesses with prohibited core activities.  
- For equity, check business lines and debt ratios; use Shariah screening tools but validate manually.

## Calculating zakat today

- Assets to include: cash, gold/silver, trade inventory, investment holdings that are for resale, and liquid portions of portfolios.  
- Exclude long-term personal assets (primary home, car) and retirement accounts not yet accessible, unless scholars advise otherwise in your context.

## Using modern tools

- Track holdings in a spreadsheet; mark zakatable vs. non-zakatable.  
- Set calendar reminders for lunar year end; many tools can follow Hijri dates.  
- Automate disbursement to verified organizations; keep receipts for transparency.

## Debt and offsets

- Deduct short-term debts due within the year (e.g., credit card balances planned to be paid).  
- Do not deduct long-term mortgages beyond the current due portion.

## Giving with impact

- Diversify between immediate relief and capacity-building (education, microfinance, clean water).  
- Prefer organizations with transparent reporting and local impact you can verify.

Ethical finance in Islam is about purity of source, fairness in trade, and uplift through zakat. Modern tools make compliance easier when paired with conscious intention.
